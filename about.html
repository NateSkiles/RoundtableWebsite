            <h2>About me</h2>
            Actively seeking to become a better programmer and person everyday. I am currently enrolled <br>
            at The Tech Academy in Portland, Oregon. Where I am learning to become a Software Developer. <br>
            I love finding the most effiecient ways to solve problems with code.<br><br>
            I haven't worked in tech since 2013, when I worked at an telephone company installing and mainting VoIP <br>
            phones in offices. I have always had a love, and apptitude, for computer engnieering and technology however, and that <br>
            hasn't changed since while I was working in other fields. In fact I'm probably more obessed now than I have ever been.
